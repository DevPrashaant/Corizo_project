Wine Classification using Machine Learning
Project for Wipro Data Science Internship

This project involved building a predictive model to classify wine types based on chemical properties. Using a dataset containing various attributes such as alcohol content, acidity levels, and other chemical factors, I applied classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The project focused on feature engineering, model optimization, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. The model successfully predicted wine categories, offering insights for quality control in the wine industry.
